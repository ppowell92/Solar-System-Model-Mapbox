# Solar-System-Model-Mapbox
Using the MapBox API to convert NASA XY coordinate data of planetary positions in the Solar System to GPS positions on the New Mexico State University campus. Using these positions, the planets are displayed on an interactive and dynamic map to give users perspective on the distances of these objects scaled down to their local space.

This unit was used in an ongoing project for NMSU's Astronomy Department.
